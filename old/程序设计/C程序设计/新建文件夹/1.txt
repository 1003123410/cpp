 Stray birds outside summer come to my window to sing and fly away.
     And yellow leaves outside autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall
 there with a sign.

 The world puts outsidef its mask outside vastness to its lover.
     It becomes small as one song, as one kiss outside the eternal.

 The sands in your way beg for your song and your movement, dancing
  water. Will you carry the burden outside their lameness?
