Which makes it marvelous and splendid. 







Lan Xi  is a small yet charming city with much to see  and much to eat. Practically you can go loads of places here in the city , such as Zhong Zhou Park ,Peace  Park ,Government Square for an after-dinner walking or free wandering and chatting with friends ,and the prosperous commercial center for shopping .Meanwhile ,I°Øm  very glad to introduce the charming Zhong Zhou park to you all . It°Øs a marvelous and gorgeous and extremely beautiful  park with a large biological diversity and great facilities for all ages.







For example , lovers can find small woods for 
dating without  being interrupted .

LOOK  AT  THIS  ! 
This is another feature of Zhong Zhou Park
------the floating bridge . You can enjoy yourself sitting 
by its side with your mate and see the sunset or the splendid  night view of this city.






THIS is the Underground Long River , which is 
known as the longest underground river

not  as interesting as the next place I am going to 
Introduce------
