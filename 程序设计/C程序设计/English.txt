 Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away.
     And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall
 there with a sign.

 The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover.
     It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal.

 The sands in your way beg for your song and your movement, dancing
  water. Will you carry the burden of their lameness?
